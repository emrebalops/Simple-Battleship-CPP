# Battleship Game (C++)

This is a console-based implementation of the classic Battleship game. It is my 7th project in C++, designed to practice arrays, loops, and conditional logic.

## Project Description
The game creates a 5x5 grid representing the sea. The player tries to sink hidden ships by entering row and column coordinates. The game provides feedback for hits, misses, and prevents duplicate shots on the same target.

## Features
- 5x5 game grid using 2D arrays.
- Input validation to prevent firing at the same location twice.
- Hit and Miss tracking system.
- Win condition check when all ships are destroyed.

## How to Run
1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
   Command: g++ main.cpp -o battleship
2. Run the executable file.
   Command: ./battleship
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter coordinates.

## Future Improvements
- Increasing the map size to 10x10.
- Randomizing ship placement logic.
- Adding a visual interface.
